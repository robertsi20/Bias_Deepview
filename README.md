## Requirements

All requirements to run DeepView are in ```requirements.txt```. 
Most of the deep netowrks in the notebooks are models implemented in ```PyTorch```/```torchvision``` but we have also an example for ```Tensorflow 2``` models. We ran the Demo with versions ```torch==1.3.1```, ```torchvision==0.4.2```, ```tensorflow==2.0.0``` or for gpu support ```tensorflow-gpu==2.0.0```.

## Installation

 1. Download the Deepview repository ```git clone -b dev https://github.com/LucaHermes/DeepView.git```
 2. Inside the DeepView-directory, run ```pip install -e .```<br>or copy the ```deepview``` folder into your working directory
